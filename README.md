# Text based Airline Management System using python

The Airline Management System is a modular, terminal-based application designed to simulate the backend operations of a commercial airline. Built using Python, 
the system follows a menu-driven architecture to provide a structured and intuitive user experience without relying on a graphical interface.
The project emphasizes backend logic, modularity, and data persistence, making it suitable for demonstrating core software engineering and programming principles.

## Core Functionalities

The system replicates essential airline workflows through an interactive console interface:

- **Flight Operations**  
  Ticket booking, seat allocation, and reservation cancellation workflows.

- **Passenger Logistics**  
  Digital web check-in processes and automated boarding pass generation.

- **Account Management**  
  User profile creation, credential verification, and booking history retrieval.

- **Administrative Logic**  
  Automated fare calculation and real-time booking updates.


## Technical Highlights
Beyond functional behavior, the project demonstrates key engineering practices:

- **Data Persistence**  
  File-handling mechanisms are used to maintain passenger records, booking data, and travel history across multiple sessions.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  The codebase is divided into logical modules, improving readability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Input Validation & Error Handling**  
  User inputs are validated to prevent invalid operations and ensure data integrity during runtime.

- **Logic-First Design**  
  By prioritizing backend logic over a GUI, the project focuses on algorithmic clarity, clean code principles, and maintainable design.
